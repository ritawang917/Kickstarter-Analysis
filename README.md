# Kickstarter Analysis

Louise wishes to determine any trend or pattern in crowdfunding fundraisers for a variety of categories and countries. The better Louise understands the dataset, the better she will be able to improve her crowdfunding fundraiser such that she has her focus on the most profitable aspect of the fundraising category.

Specifically, the project will focus on how theater crowdfunding performed since launch date as well the percentage of outcomes of different ranges of the goals set across the subcategory of plays. 

The Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, shown in the image below, shows that there were relatively more successful theater crowdfunding fundraisers than the failed or canceled outcomes. Additionally, the graph shows that in the month of May, theater crowdfunding fundraiser was at the peak compared to the other months of the year.

The Outcomes Based on Goals, shown in the image above, shows that for the range in which the percentage of successful outcomes is increasing, the percentage of failed outcomes is decreasing, and vice versa; this shows an indirectly proportional relationship as there were no canceled plays. The dataset given in the Kickstarter spreadsheet is limited as it does not specify the reason as to why the crowdfunding fundraiser was successful for one but not the other; for example, one play could have failed in one country but be successful in another. Creating a graph displaying the outcome depending on the total time spent on the crowdfunding performance will greatly help Louise, as she can see if she needs to shorten or lengthen the time of crowdfunding performance fundraiser to seek the highest number of successful outcomes.
